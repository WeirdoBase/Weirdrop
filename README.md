# Weirdrop Contract

## Overview

The Weirdrop contract is a core component of the WEIRDO ecosystem, dedicated to unifying and rewarding the community of "weirdos" on the blockchain. Deployed on Base, this contract facilitates the distribution of WEIRDO tokens through two primary functions: a standard airdrop and a variable airdrop. These functions allow for the spreading of "weirdness" by distributing tokens to multiple recipients either evenly or in varying amounts based on predefined criteria.

### Contract Address

The Weirdrop contract is deployed on the Base blockchain at the following address:

```
0x367B2DF346160Ca2CA30d63b0a3ACCA5FcB02670
```

## Features

1. **Standard Airdrop (`weirdrop`)**: Allows a user to distribute a fixed amount of WEIRDO tokens to an array of recipients. This function preloads the total amount of tokens into the contract and then disperses them, minimizing the need for repeated allowance checks and reducing gas costs.

2. **Variable Airdrop (`variableWeirdrop`)**: Facilitates the distribution of different amounts of tokens to each recipient according to an array of specified amounts. This is particularly useful for custom airdrops where different participants might deserve different rewards.

## How to Interact with the Contract

To interact with the Weirdrop contract, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a wallet supported by the Base chain.
- Acquire some WEIRDO tokens and hold them in your wallet.
- Approve the contract to handle the necessary amount of WEIRDO tokens by calling the `approve` method on the WEIRDO token contract, specifying the Weirdrop contract address and the amount.

### Using the Weirdrop Function

1. **Prepare Data**: List the recipient addresses and determine the amount of tokens each should receive (if using `variableWeirdrop`).

2. **Execute Airdrop**:
   - For `weirdrop`, provide the array of recipients and the uniform token amount.
   - For `variableWeirdrop`, provide both the array of recipients and the corresponding amounts.

### Example Interaction (Web3.js)

Here is a basic example of how to interact with the Weirdrop contract using Web3.js:

```javascript
const contractAddress = '0x367B2DF346160Ca2CA30d63b0a3ACCA5FcB02670';
const abi = [ /* ABI generated by your contract compilation */ ];
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Example of using the weirdrop function
const recipients = ["0x...", "0x..."];
const value = 100; // Amount of WEIRDO tokens each recipient will receive
contract.methods.weirdrop(recipients, value).send({from: '0xYourWalletAddress'})
  .then(function(receipt){
      console.log("Transaction successful: ", receipt);
  });

// Example of using the variableWeirdrop function
const amounts = [100, 200]; // Varying amounts for each recipient
contract.methods.variableWeirdrop(recipients, amounts).send({from: '0xYourWalletAddress'})
  .then(function(receipt){
      console.log("Transaction successful: ", receipt);
  });
```
